# twitter-clone

A basic twitter client and server implementation created using ChatGPT and OpenAI.

Contains the OpenAPI definition, scalable infrastructure definitions for AWS and Azure, back end and front end code.

I got bored and stopped but this is a good chunk of the way to something workable.

Generated with love by OpenAI and a human dev (me).
